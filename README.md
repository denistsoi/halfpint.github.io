# Denistsoi.github.io

A Visual Repository of my work history, development talks and work-related projects

### Explanation

Was previously using jekyll, but switching between js/ruby abit annoying, especially serving scss files. By using quesadilla, I can have my automated build environment, and just focus on markup and style changes. (rather than waiting for the build process to finish).

Also - by structuring the respository in the current, allows me to utilise github-pages and not `require` jekyll within my development process.

I can also figure out how to move _posts into respective /project/work/talk folder, within my dev process - idk - still thinking about this right now.



### Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:denistsoi/denistsoi.github.io
cd denistsoi.github.io
npm install
npm start
```

### Publishing style changes
// will fix this in either pre-commit or within build process

```
npm run push
```
