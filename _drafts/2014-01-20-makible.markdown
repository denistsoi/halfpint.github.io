### 3D Printing based startup

As a hobbyist maker, I was already fascinated with 3D printing before I even started as a developer.
When I was let go from Imagination; instead of waking up on the following week with a sense of failure, 
I asked a good friend from Makible to allow me to continue my progression as a programmer under Makible.

Unfortunately, like with many startups, this was a precursor to understanding how fragile a company can easily fall apart, despite the best of intentions.
