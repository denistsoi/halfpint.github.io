                  <p>As a hobbyist maker, I was already fascinated with 3D printing before I started as a developer.</p>
                  <p>When I was let go from Imagination; I wanted to resist the impending anxiety of being unemployed and feeling like a failure. I asked a good friend from Makible to allow me to continue my progression as a programmer...</p>
                  <p>It was my first experience working for a startup...</p>

                  <h3>Pacific Place Mall Interactive Kiosk</h3>
                  <p>This was the first job that exposed me to the world of Web Design and Digital Agencies.</p>
                  <p>Though I was not able to oversee the final installation of the project, due to my inexperience at the time, visiting the kiosk gave me a sense of pride at being able to work on something so influential in my career...</p>
