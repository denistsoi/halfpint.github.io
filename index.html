                <p>During that time, I oversaw frontend development, with respect to stream-lining their build system using gulp.js</p>
                <p>I also took some time to visit Singapore, where I gave a talk about lockpicks for Makers' Block 2014 Singapore.</p>

                <p>Before I regularly performed on stage at an Open Mic Night, I found doing any public speaking quite unnerving. As such, I gave myself the challenge of overcoming my anxiety by desensitising myself to public speaking.</p>
                <p>After performing for a few months, I began a short series of interviews where I asked artists, poets and writers from Hong Kong's Literary and Arts scene about being published and other respective experiences.</p>
